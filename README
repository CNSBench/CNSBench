Prerequisites
-------------

Install v0.18 of the Operator SDK and CLI tool: https://v0-18-x.sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/install-operator-sdk/
Install additional prerequisites for Golang based Operators: https://v0-18-x.sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/golang/installation/

Setup
-----

Install the custom resource definition for the Benchmark object:
`kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/cnsbench.example.com_benchmarks_crd.yaml`

TODO: Describe how to install Workload Library.

Running
-------

Make sure the KUBECONFIG environment variable is set, e.g.
`export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config`

Run the controller with `operator-sdk run local`

TODO: Add sample Benchmark YAML files.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If for some reason the controller crashes and a Benchmark resource still has a
finalizer set, it is safe to manually remove the finalizer so that the resource
can be deleted.  To do so, do `kubectl edit benchmark <resource name>` and
delete the line containing the finalizer.
