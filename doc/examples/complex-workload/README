The files in this directory demonstrate a "complex" workload: a distributed
key-value store (etcd), accessed by multiple clients.

etcd.yaml contains all of the resources necessary to instantiate both clients
and an etcd server with multiple replicas.  The resources used to instantiate
etcd are based on the Helm charts from Bitnami[0].

benchmark.yaml runs a benchmark that instantiates multiple clients, which run
etcd's benchmark utility[1] to generate a workload.  The parser extracts the
"requests per second" metric reported at the end of each run.  The output is
sent to the output collection server described in examples/output.
