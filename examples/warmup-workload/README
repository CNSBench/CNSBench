The files in this directory demonstrate running a workload that requires a

- fio.yaml: I/O workload specification that runs the fio benchmark.  Uses an
  init container to warmup the system under test.  CNSBench can synchronize
  multiple workloads so that the primary workload only begins after all warmup
  workloads have completed.
- benchmark.yaml: Benchmark that runs the fio workload.  Uses the output
  collector server described in examples/output/
